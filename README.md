This is just a school project for a simple image processing program. It was for our 2D array unit, and the program has 2 main methods, one for setting the bitmap from the array, and one that does the opposite.
the browse button allows you to choose any picture file, and it is filtered using the SystemFileDialog method to make sure you can only choose picture files
There are many features in the program, and they all just manipulate the main 2D array, which has 320 rows and 240 columns, which means that any picture you choose will immediatly be converted to 320 by 240 pixels
